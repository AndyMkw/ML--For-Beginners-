# Explore classification methods

## Instruções

In [Scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html) you'll find a large list of ways to classify data. Do a little scavenger hunt in these docs: your goals is to look for classification methods and match a dataset in this curriculum, a question you can ask of it, and a technique of classification. Create a spreadsheet or table in a .doc file and explain how the dataset would work with the classification algorithm.
